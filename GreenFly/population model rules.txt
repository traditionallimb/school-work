1. Only females
2. Seniles - too old to reproduce
   Adults - reproducing
   Juveniles - too young to reproduce
3. End of generation:
   all surviving seniles remain as seniles
   all surviving adults change into seniles
   all surviving juveniles change into adults
4. Survival rate = 0 -> no individuals survive to next gen
   Survival rate = 1 -> all individuals survive to next gen
   Survival rate = 0.25 -> quarter survive to next gen

   new num = current num * survival rate
5. Birthrate is on average

   new num of juveniles = current adults * birthrate
6. Number of individuals measured in thousands
7. EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE SET BEFORE RUN
